# Parity Acceptance Checklist

## Parity Checks
- Homepage module order matches Sejong parity spec: Hero Search → Suggested Keywords → Suggested Categories → Major News → Firm Updates → YouTube → Deals/Cases (Guides) → Newsletters → Warning Banner.
- Header pattern: brand left, primary nav center, utility cluster right (search, language switch, primary CTA).
- Global search overlay present with tabs (Services / Insights / Videos / FAQ) and suggested keyword chips.
- Major news uses 1 featured item + list items with meta/date and short summaries.
- Firm updates uses tabs or multi-list with compact rows (meta + title + tag).
- YouTube module includes featured video + secondary items + “view more” link.
- Deals/Cases module is implemented as “Guides” when no factual case outcomes exist.
- Newsletter module exists as a compact list (avoid fabricated issue data).
- Warning banner is neutral and does not claim actual incidents.
- Contact page is grouped by inquiry type and uses placeholders where data is missing.

## Do-Not-Copy Checklist
- No proprietary Sejong assets, imagery, icons, or logos used.
- No Sejong CSS copied; all styles are original.
- No proprietary Sejong copy, headlines, or data reused verbatim.
- No invented claims (awards, rankings, client logos, case outcomes, metrics).
- All external links are limited to user-provided sources and our own content.
