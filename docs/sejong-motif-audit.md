# Sejong Motif Audit

## IA Patterns To Adopt
- Header with multi-column mega menu for key categories (Services, Insights)
- Search-forward hero with a prominent global search bar
- Recommended keyword chips directly beneath search
- Featured news/insights module with a lead item and supporting items
- Multi-list updates module (tabs for Firm News / Media / Seminars)
- Video channel section with one featured video and a small list
- Professional contact structure with grouped inquiry blocks

## Current Site Weaknesses (Observed)
- Too few visual anchors; sections blend together without clear hierarchy
- Weak typographic contrast; headings and body appear similar in weight/scale
- Generic spacing and rhythm; lacks editorial pacing and section breaks
- No high-impact navigation patterns (mega menu, search-forward UX)
- Minimal surface treatment; missing layered cards, dividers, and ornaments
- Call-to-action placement is not prominent or consistent
